# Chest Disease Diagnosis Using ResNet and X-Ray Images

This project involves the use of deep learning, particularly a pre-trained ResNet model, to diagnose chest diseases using chest X-ray images.

## Contents

The Jupyter notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Import Libraries and Dataset**: We import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. The dataset used in this project is a collection of chest X-ray images, which is loaded from a specified directory.

2. **Data Visualization**: We perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data better. This part usually involves displaying some of the images from the dataset, checking the distribution of classes, etc.

3. **Import Model with Pretrained Weights**: We load a pre-trained ResNet model. ResNet, or Residual Networks, is a classic neural network used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks. This pre-trained model will serve as a fixed feature extractor or as a base for further fine-tuning.

4. **Train ResNet Model with the New Dataset**: Here, we train the ResNet model with our dataset of chest X-ray images. We also apply various callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, and LearningRateScheduler for efficient training.

Please note that the data used in this project is not publicly available and needs to be provided separately.
